# REACT FINAL PROJECT

Hi, <br>
Thank you for checking my react project.

For better results there are a few actions that you need to do:

## In order to insert a default data into the database please run in POSTMAN the following request: PUT http://localhost:8080/init

After that you will be able to get all the values required from database

##   *All <u>default</u> users password is 123456
